                               POWER OF ATTORNEY
			      ------------------


      KNOW ALL PERSONS BY THESE PRESENTS, that I, the undersigned, a director
and/or officer of CBS Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
hereby constitute and appoint Lawrence P. Tu, Jonathan Anschell, Matthew D.

the other, for me and in my name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to
  execute and file for and on behalf of the undersigned (i) any reports on Forms
  3, 4 and 5 (including any amendments thereto and any successors to such Forms)
  with respect to ownership of securities of the Company, that the undersigned
may be required to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in
accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
