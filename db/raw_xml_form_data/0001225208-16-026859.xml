                               POWER OF ATTORNEY
			      ------------------


      KNOW ALL PERSONS BY THESE PRESENTS, that I, the undersigned, a director
and/or officer of CBS Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
hereby constitute and appoint Lawrence P. Tu, Jonathan Anschell, Matthew D.

  execute and file for and on behalf of the undersigned (i) any reports on Forms

       The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorney-in-fact, in
